"""
**Dycco** is another Python port of [Docco][docco], the quick-and-dirty,
hundred-line-long, literate-programming-style documentation generator.

Dycco reads Python source files and produces annotated source documentation in
HTML format. Comments and docstrings are formatted with [Markdown][markdown]
and presented as annotations alongside the source code, which is
syntax-highlighted by [Pygments][pygments]. This page is the result of running
Dycco against its [own source file][dycco].

Dycco differs from Nick Fitzgerald's [Pycco][pycco], the first Python port of
[Docco][docco], in that it only knows how to generate documenation on Python
source code and it uses that specialization to more accurately parse
documentation. It does so using a two-pass parsing stage, first walking the
*Abstract Syntax Tree* of the code to gather up docstrings, then examining the
code line-by-line to extract comments.

Dycco's HTML and CSS are taken straight from [Docco][docco], but, like
[Pycco][pycco], Dycco uses [Mustache][mustache] templates rendered by
[Pystache][pystache]. The first version of Dycco's templates and CSS were
taken straight from [Pycco][pycco], then updated to match the latest changes
to [Docco][docco]'s.

    The data structure returned is a special `dict` whose keys are the line
    numbers where sections start, which map to `dict`s containing the docs and
    code associated with those sections. The docs and code are stored as
    lists, which will be joined in post processing.

    It will look a little like this:

        { 1: { 'docs': ['...', '...'],
               'code': ['...', '...'] },
          9: { 'docs': ['...', '...'],
               'code': ['...', '...'] } }

    The docs for each section can come from docstrings (the first pass) or
    from comments (the second pass). The line numbers start at zero, for
    simplicity's sake.
